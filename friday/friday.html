    <p>Learning about bootstrap</p>
    <p>Bootstrap is a wireframe that does easy web designing.</p>
    <article>
      <!-- columns and rows -->
      <h2>columns and rows</h2>
      <p>Starters, we started with col and rows. One can build or segment the web layout using th ecolumns and rows.</p>
      <p>A normal screen has 12 columns and this is equaly divided. Hence while building ensure that the web page takes this i effect</p>
      <p>each col can span a max of 12. each spanning depends on how it is defined.</p>
      <!-- background color -->
       <h2>background color</h2>
       <p>Bootstrap is configured with some fixed colors like warning, success, infor, primary, secondary among others</p>
       <p>this colos are inout by the variation bg-(color)</p>
       <!-- sizez -->
        <p>there are different sizes of screen fitting. Instead of using media querry one can use this</p>
        <ol>
          types of sizes and property representation using container
          <li>.container &gt; very small. this means it fits on the small mobile screen </li>
          <li>.container-sm &gt; small. This fit in the small container</li>
          <li>.container-md &gt; medium. This fit in the medium mobile screen and tablets</li>
          <li>.container-lg &gt; large. This fit in large screen size</li>
          <li>.container-xl &gt; this fit in extra large screen size</li>
          <li>.container xxl &gt; This fit in the extra extra large screen size</li>

        <iframe src="portfolio/index-0.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </article>
    <p>One can decide to span the col in relation with the screen size. This enables the screen to change accordingly 
      with different screen sizes
    </p>
    <!-- justifying content -->
     <h2>justifying content</h2>
     <p>This is like aligning of content. One can align it at the start of a text, at the center or at the end</p>
     <p>Apart from this one can use the col + the screen size + the justify content simultinously to work through
      setting up or fitting screen size evenly.
     </p>
     <!-- properties -->
      <h2>properties</h2>
      <p>There are multiple properties that can be used in bootstrap. some examples of what we used include</p>
      <ol>
        <li>gap this creates a sort of gap between the border content</li>
        <li>d-flex &gt; this is a sort of container of flex type used to place objects in it.</li>
        <li>display &gt; display enaounciete or sizes the text in an appealing manner</li>
        <li>border &gt; from css this speaks for itself</li>
        <li>fw &gt; this represent font weight</li>
        <li>fs &gt; this represent font size. if it fst this is the italic format of the sized text</li>
        <li>my o mx &gt;This is the margin in the vertical or howizontal respectively</li>
        <li>p &gt; this represent padding </li>
